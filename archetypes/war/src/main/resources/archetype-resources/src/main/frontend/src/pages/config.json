  "text": "<p>Welcome to Portofino 5. This is your new application.</p><p>Initially, the application has the user admin/admin built in. You can use that to <a href='portofino-upstairs/wizard'>run the wizard</a>, connect to your database, and build a complete application in a few clicks. Please refer to the <a href='https://github.com/ManyDesigns/Portofino/wiki/Getting-started-with-Portofino-5' target='_blank'>getting started page</a>.</p><p>The wizard is one of the tools that can be found in the administration section <a href='portofino-upstairs'>&quot;upstairs&quot;</a> (link in the toolbar). The &quot;upstairs&quot; section is optional and can be disabled in production, leaving only the &quot;downstairs&quot; floor, i.e., the application.</p><p><small>&quot;Upstairs&quot; and &quot;downstairs&quot; are historical references to Portofino 3, which used the same model-driven interface both for the application itself and for modeling the application.</small></p><h3>API</h3><p>Your application exposes a REST API which depends on the resource-actions that it's made of. When, for example, you create a CRUD page, a corresponding resource-action is created for you. You can download the documentation of the REST API in OpenAPI (aka Swagger) format, by accessing the app's API root resource which by default is located at <a href='api'>/api</a>. This is machine-readable, so you can generate a client automatically in many programming languages from it. Note that currently the OpenAPI documentation is cached, and if you change the structure of the application, you'll have to restart it in order to see the updated documentation.</p><h3>I want to know more</h3><p>You can find additional documentation in the <a href='https://github.com/ManyDesigns/Portofino/wiki' target='_blank'>wiki</a>.</p>"
