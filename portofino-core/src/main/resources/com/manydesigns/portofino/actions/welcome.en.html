    <title>Welcome to Portofino</title>

<h1>Your Portofino application is online</h1>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<h2>API</h2>
<p>Your application exposes a REST API which depends on the resource-actions that it's made of. You can <a href='openapi.json'>download the documentation of the REST API</a> in OpenAPI (aka Swagger) format. This is machine-readable, so you can generate a client automatically in many programming languages from it. </p>
<p>Note that currently the OpenAPI documentation is cached, and if you change the structure of the application, you'll have to restart it in order to see the updated documentation.</p>
<h2>I want to know more</h2>
<p>You can find additional documentation on the <a href='https://manydesigns.github.io/Portofino' target='_blank'>website</a> and in the <a href='https://github.com/ManyDesigns/Portofino/wiki' target='_blank'>wiki</a> on GitHub.
